 # MiniBot

This project will produce a PCB design that can be used for prototyping remote control vehicles. It is inspired by the University of Canterbury ECE Departments 'Wacky Racers' competition. The objective is to follow most of the rules of that competition however the entire design will fit on a single PCB and be as small as possible.

 ## Requirements
  - Support a number of external ESCs and Servos.
  - Communicate with a laptop or smartphone via. Bluetooth.
  - Be able to take still images and transmit then to the controller.
  - It should include an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer for any control systems.
  - Be programmable over JTAG or USB.
  - Use as minimum number of parts.
  - Make use of an STM32 microcontroller.
